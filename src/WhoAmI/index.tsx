        My name is Allan Brito dos Santos, working as Back-End Developer in a tecnology company but I'm in programming area for 10 years. I started programming for Industrial Automation, coding for PLCs (Programming Logic Controllers) Devices that act for monitoring and supervision of HVAC (Air Conditioning). Then, I changed to Comercial Automation programming. At the last company that I worked, I contributed at the implementation of new features in software to attend pubs and restaurants. And then our team grew the customer's range and we make a deal with the most important Brazil's delivery app. Beyond back-end, I code in front-end using JavaFx, JavaScript and React. You can see and follow my projects and system's portfolios accessing my GitHub or going in "Projects" section down below.
